# Top-Down-Shooter
Game made in Godot inspired [jmbiv's Godot top-down-shooter tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpwc3ughKbZexDyPexHN2MXLliKAovkpl).

## Features
Single player, top-down shooting with two opposing teams capturing bases </br>
### Original
Created in the tutorial
* Different weapons
* Friendly and Enemy team with AI
* Base capturing
* Title, pause and gameover screens
* Automatic respawning for all agents
* Particle effects </br>
### Add-Ons
Created by me
* Buying:
  * Added money from controlled bases
  * Buyable guns, turrets and extra team members
  * Shopping AI so the enemy team buys upgrades themselves
  * Made a menu for buying that is updated dynamically 
* Weapons:
  * Scrollable weapon selection
  * Weapon manager for actors
  * Shotgun
  * Different gun damage multiplier
  * Muzzle flash particles
* Turrets
* UI base state
* Fixed so you can spawn more team members than spawn points
</br>
## TODO:
If I ever come back to this project
* A base with health for each team that needs to be destoryed to end the game (think age of war)
* Fix it so that enemies that get shot by someone out of their detection range will get alerted and move toward the shooter
</br>
